# Sub-C Test Files

### [**`tests/c-input/`**](/tests/c-input/)

  > Contains **example C programs** that are compatible with the strict subset of
  > C supported by the Sub-C compiler.

### [**`tests/s-output/`**](/tests/s-output/)

  > Contains the corresponding ARMv7 assembly generated by the Sub-C compiler for

## Compilation on a Normal C Compiler

If you wish to compile the example programs in [**`tests/c-input/`**](/tests/c-input/)
using a standard C compiler, you'll need to define the following intrinsics:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define __says(x) (0 * printf("%s", x))
#define __sayn(x) (0 * printf("%d", x))
#define __sayl(x) (0 * printf("\n"))
```

The macros above simulate the builtin output functions of the Sub-C compiler.
All the test files in [**`tests/c-input/`**](/tests/c-input/) have these macros
defined (but commented out). To compile them using a normal C compiler, you must
uncomment the macros.
